# Iteration #2 Plan

In this iteration, we will focus on four key fronts:
1. Authentication: Users should be able to create accounts and log in into
   the app.
2. Implementing the Landing Page with categorized books for users to pick from.
3. Creating the Book Details Page for detailed book information.
4. Integrating the “Post Review” feature directly from the Book Details Page.

## 1. Authentication
### Objective
Users should be able to create and account and log in into the app.
Only users who have successfully logged in should have access to our app.

## 2. Landing Page

### Objective
• Provide users with an engaging entry point into the application.  
• Showcase a variety of book categories (e.g., “Best Sellers,”
“New Arrivals,” “Recommended Reads”).

### Functionality Overview
• Display multiple carousel-like sections or grids,
each representing a distinct book category.  
• Offer quick access to book details through clickable book items.  
• Allow users to navigate (e.g., via menu or links) to other parts
of the application.

## 3. Book Details Page

### Objective
• Show detailed information about a single book.  
• Enable users to read existing reviews and ratings.  
• Provide a structured place for the “Post Review” functionality.

### Functionality Overview
• Display book title, author, synopsis, average rating,
and existing reviews.  
• Provide easy navigation options to return to the Landing Page
or explore other books.  
• Integrate a prominent call-to-action to add a new review.

## 4. Post Review Use Case

### Objective
• Allow users to submit new book reviews, including text and rating.  
• Update the book’s overall rating and review list immediately.

### Functionality Overview
• Provide a form where users can enter the review
contents and rating (e.g., star rating and a written string review.).  
• Validate that the review has essential content
(e.g., non-empty text).  
• Save the review to the database and update the Book Details
Page in real time.

## Expected Results

By the end of this iteration, we expect the following
capabilities to be fully functional:  
• A visually appealing Landing Page that shows book categories.  
• A Book Details Page containing thorough information and existing reviews.
- A Post Review form that enables registered users
to post their reviews and see updates immediately.

# Iteration #3 Plan 
- In this iteration, we will focus on making the app fully interactive and functional using a GUI, 
including authentication, a landing page, book details, and review posting.
- The Manage Review feature (editing and deleting reviews) will possibly be added as well.

## Key Goals for Iteration #3:

### 1. Finalize Authentication Process:
- Enable users to create accounts and log in to access the app. (at this stage, we are still 
going to allow users to log in dynamically just as we did in the previous phase. 
We will only ask for their username and email.)
- Ensure that only authenticated users can access book details and post reviews.

### 2. Landing Page UI:

- Design and develop a functional landing page that showcases various book categories.
- Provide navigation options to access different sections of the app (book details, reviews).

### 3. Book Details Page UI:

- Design the Book Details Page to display a book’s title, author, average rating, and reviews etc.
- Add a user-friendly interface to allow users to navigate back to the Landing Page or explore other books.
- Display existing reviews, with the option to post new reviews. (Since we won't be using any
databases, we are thinking of maybe using something like collections to store 
user information and the reviews that they have previously written, which we will then
show to other users.)


### 4. Post Review Form Implementation:

- Create an interface for users to submit reviews, 
including a text box for written feedback and a star-rating input for the score.
- Ensure the form validates user inputs 

### 5. Manage Review (Optional):

- If implemented, users will be able to manage their reviews directly from the Book Details Page:
- Edit Review - Users can modify their existing review.
- Delete Review -  Users can remove their review entirely.


## Expected Results
After this iteration, users will basically be able to log in and start using some features:
post reviews, explore books and book reviews with actual visualizations. If implemented,
users will be able to manage their reviews already posted. (they can either delete or
modify their previous reviews)


# Iteration #4 Plan

In this iteration, we will take LitLore from a single‑device prototype 
to a social and persistent experience by introducing follow/like interactions, wish‑lists, user profiles
