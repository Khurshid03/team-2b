# Glossary

### **1. Book Detail Page**
A specific web page or section within the app where detailed
information about a particular book is displayed. This includes
information like title, author, user reviews, ratings, and related
actions (e.g., posting a review, saving the book to a wishlist,
or like a review).

---

### **2. Wishlist**
A personalized list where users can save books they are
interested in reading or reviewing later. Users can toggle
books in and out of their wishlist using a "Save to Wishlist"
or "Remove from Wishlist" button.

---

### **3. Real-time Updates**
Changes or updates that are reflected in the app interface
instantly after an action is performed. For example, if a user
posts a review, likes a comment, or follows someone, the change
becomes visible to all relevant users without needing to refresh
the page.

---

### **4. Authentication**
The process through which a user logs into the app using
credentials (e.g., email and password). Only authenticated users
can access certain features like posting reviews, liking comments,
or following others.

---

### **5. Review Management**
The ability for users to edit or delete their own reviews. This includes
updating review content (text and rating) or
removing a review entirely from the app.

---

### **6. Failure Scenarios**
Situations where the intended action of a user does not complete successfully.
For example:
- **Network Issues**: Preventing reviews or likes from being posted.
- **Permission Issues**: Attempting to edit/delete content that a user doesn’t own.

In these cases, the app provides feedback to users, such as error messages.
